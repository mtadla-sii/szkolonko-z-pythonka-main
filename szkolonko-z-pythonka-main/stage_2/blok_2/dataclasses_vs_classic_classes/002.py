# how to store a comment in web application

# However dict may only good to have within the same file
# and hopefully within 20-30 lines of code for easier access to the kyes - which are strings
# this may lead to human error - misspelling the key, which ends up with error AT RUNTIME
# so this is way to late - the test may fail on pipeline if not executed locally.
# the proposition is to create a class representing a model of the object
